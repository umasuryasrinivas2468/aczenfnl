# Cashfree Order Token Issue Fix

## Problem

Cashfree API has changed their interface and no longer supports the `order_token` parameter in the return URL. The error message was:

```
Network error - Make sure your server is running at http://localhost:5003: return_url no longer supports order_token
```

## Solution

We've updated the integration to work with Cashfree's latest API by making the following changes:

1. **Updated return_url format**: 
   - Removed the `order_token` parameter from the return URL
   - Now using only `order_id` parameter: `https://example.com/payment-status?order_id={order_id}`

2. **Replaced payment-links endpoint with sessions endpoint**:
   - Instead of using `/orders/{orderId}/payment-links` endpoint
   - Now using `/orders/{orderId}/sessions` endpoint which doesn't require order_token

3. **Updated client-side handling**:
   - Modified the PaymentSuccess component to not rely on order_token
   - Updated the payment service to handle the new response format

## Technical Changes

### Server-side changes:

1. In `server/api/create-cashfree-order.js`:
   - Updated the return_url format in the order creation endpoint
   - Replaced the payment-links endpoint with sessions endpoint
   - Added proper logging of API responses

2. In `src/pages/PaymentSuccess.tsx`:
   - Removed references to order_token
   - Added better error handling
   - Updated to use the correct port (5003)

3. In `src/lib/services/payment.ts`:
   - Updated variable names from token to session
   - Updated error messages to be more specific

## Testing

To test the integration:

1. Start the server: `npm run server`
2. Start the frontend: `npm run dev`
3. Try making a payment through the UI
4. Check the server logs for any errors

## Important Notes

1. This fix works with Cashfree's latest API (as of August 2023)
2. We're using the production environment for this integration
3. The return URL still needs to be HTTPS, which is why we're using example.com as a placeholder

If Cashfree makes additional changes to their API, you may need to update this integration again. Always refer to their latest documentation.
