# Cashfree Integration Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **HTTPS Return URL**: Cashfree requires HTTPS URLs for return_url and notify_url parameters. We've updated the API to use https://example.com URLs that meet this requirement.

2. **Production vs Sandbox Environment**: Your Cashfree API credentials are valid for the Production environment but not the Sandbox environment. We've updated the server to use the correct environment.

3. **API Endpoint Port**: The frontend was trying to connect to the wrong port. We've updated the configuration to use port 5003 to match the server.

4. **Better Error Handling**: Added more detailed error handling to provide clearer information when things go wrong.

## Files Changed

1. **server/api/create-cashfree-order.js**: 
   - Updated to use production environment
   - Fixed HTTPS return_url requirement
   - Added better logging

2. **src/components/BuyDialog.tsx**:
   - Updated API URL to use correct port
   - Improved error handling
   - Added more detailed error messages

3. **src/lib/services/payment.ts**:
   - Updated API URL to use correct port
   - Improved error reporting

## How to Use

1. **Start both server and client**:
   ```
   ./start.bat
   ```
   This will start both the backend server on port 5003 and the frontend on port 5173.

2. **Check server status**:
   Visit http://localhost:5003 to verify the server is running.

3. **Test the integration**:
   ```
   node test-cashfree-auth.cjs
   ```
   This will test the Cashfree API credentials against both Production and Sandbox environments.

## Important Notes

1. **Production Credentials**: The integration is using PRODUCTION credentials, which means real transactions could occur. Be careful when testing with real money.

2. **HTTPS Requirement**: In a production environment, you would need to set up proper HTTPS URLs for return_url and notify_url. For development, we're using example.com as a placeholder.

3. **Return URL Handling**: When going to production, make sure to update the return_url to point to your actual application domain with HTTPS.

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. Make sure the server is running (check http://localhost:5003)
2. Check server logs for detailed error messages
3. Verify that your Cashfree credentials are still valid
4. Try running the test script: `node test-cashfree-auth.cjs`
