# Cashfree Integration with Backend Token Generation

## Overview

The error "No request found with code..." occurs when trying to directly generate a payment URL on the frontend. The correct approach is to use Cashfree's backend token generation flow:

1. Create an order on the backend
2. Generate a payment session/token on the backend
3. Redirect to Cashfree using the token

## Implementation Details

### Backend Implementation

The backend handles all secure API interactions with Cashfree:

1. **Create Order Endpoint** (`/api/create-cashfree-order`):
   - Requires: `orderAmount`, `orderId`, and `customerDetails`
   - Creates a payment order in Cashfree
   - Returns: `order_id`, `payment_session_id`, and `cf_order_id`

2. **Generate Token Endpoint** (`/api/create-payment-token`):
   - Requires: `orderId` 
   - Generates a payment token specific to that order
   - Returns: `payment_link` and `payment_token`

3. **Verify Payment Status** (`/api/payment-status/:orderId`):
   - Checks status of a payment
   - Returns: Payment status details directly from Cashfree

### Frontend Implementation

The frontend handles user interaction and redirects:

1. **Payment Service**: 
   - Collects payment details from the user
   - Calls backend to create order
   - Calls backend to generate payment token
   - Redirects user to Cashfree's payment page

2. **Payment Status Page**:
   - Handles the return from Cashfree
   - Verifies payment status with backend
   - Shows appropriate success/failure message

## Security Considerations

This approach is more secure because:

1. API credentials remain on the server, never exposed to clients
2. Prevents tampering with payment amounts or details
3. Follows Cashfree's recommended integration pattern
4. Simplifies webhook integration for payment confirmations

## Testing

1. Run the server: `cd server && npm run dev`
2. Run the frontend: `npm run dev`
3. Navigate to the payment page
4. Fill in payment details and submit
5. Complete the payment on Cashfree's page
6. You'll be redirected back to the status page
