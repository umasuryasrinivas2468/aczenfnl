# Final Cashfree Integration Fixes

## Issues Fixed

We've resolved multiple issues with the Cashfree payment integration:

1. **HTTPS URL Requirement**: 
   - Fixed by using `https://example.com` URLs for return_url and notify_url

2. **order_token Parameter**:
   - Removed the deprecated `order_token` parameter from return_url
   - Updated to use only `order_id` parameter: `?order_id={order_id}`

3. **API Endpoint Correction**:
   - Changed from attempting to use `/sessions` endpoint to using the working `/payment-links` endpoint
   - Modified the request to meet Cashfree's latest API requirements

4. **Port Configuration**:
   - Changed server port from 5003 to 5004 to avoid conflicts
   - Ensured all components use port 5004 consistently

5. **Better Error Handling**:
   - Added more detailed error messages throughout the integration
   - Implemented proper logging of API responses and errors

## Technical Implementation

The correct Cashfree payment flow is now:

1. **Backend creates an order** (`/api/create-cashfree-order`):
   ```javascript
   // Order data with return_url that only uses order_id
   const orderData = {
     order_amount: orderAmount,
     order_currency: 'INR',
     order_id: orderId,
     customer_details: {...},
     order_meta: {
       return_url: `https://example.com/payment-status?order_id={order_id}`,
       notify_url: `https://example.com/api/cashfree-webhook`
     }
   };
   ```

2. **Backend generates payment link** (`/api/create-payment-token`):
   ```javascript
   // Using the payment-links endpoint with empty request body
   const paymentLinkResponse = await axios.post(
     `${CASHFREE_ENVIRONMENT}/orders/${orderId}/payment-links`,
     {}, // Empty body - let Cashfree use defaults
     { headers: {...} }
   );
   
   // Return only the payment_link and order_id
   return res.json({
     payment_link: paymentLinkResponse.data.link_url,
     order_id: orderId
   });
   ```

3. **Frontend redirects to payment page**:
   ```typescript
   // Redirect to the payment link
   window.location.href = paymentData.payment_link;
   ```

4. **Handle payment completion**:
   ```typescript
   // PaymentSuccess component now only looks for order_id in URL
   const orderId = queryParams.get('order_id');
   // No more order_token
   ```

## Testing

1. Make sure the server is running on port 5004:
   ```
   cd server && npm run dev
   ```

2. Start the frontend:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Try making a payment through the UI - it should now work correctly.

## Fixes to Remember

1. **PORT ISSUES**: If you get "address already in use" errors, change the port or kill the existing process:
   ```
   taskkill /F /PID <process_id>  # Find PID using: netstat -ano | findstr :<port>
   ```

2. **CREDENTIAL ISSUES**: Your Cashfree credentials work with the Production environment, not Sandbox.

3. **API VERSION**: Cashfree's API changes frequently - this integration works with API version 2022-09-01.

## Important Notes

1. The current integration is using PRODUCTION credentials - real transactions will occur.
   
2. The return URL needs to be HTTPS for Cashfree to accept it, which is why we're using example.com as a placeholder.

3. For a real production deployment, you'll need to update the return_url to your actual HTTPS domain.
